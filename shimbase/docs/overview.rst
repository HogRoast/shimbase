Overview
========
An object oriented database abstraction library. The aim is to provide a simple library for manipulating relational database tables via python objects. The abstraction should allow for any relational database implementation (e.g. SQLite3) to be plugged in, meaning application code can be written in a database independent fashion.

The library has been built to be as generic as possible, however the only implementation provided currently is for SQLite3 so there may be a slight leaning towards this implementation. This will be ironed out as more implementations are added.

This package comes with a MIT license, so feel free to do what you like with it.
